KCSE School Performance Dashboard (2015–2024).

Overview.
This project presents a multi-page Power BI dashboard analyzing KCSE school performance over a ten-year period (2015–2024).
It is designed to support school leadership and education stakeholders by highlighting performance trends, subject strengths and weaknesses, gender gaps, and intervention priorities.

Note: The dataset used in this project is simulated for portfolio and learning purposes, but structured to reflect realistic KCSE performance patterns.

Objectives.
1. Build an end-to-end analytics solution from raw data to executive dashboards.
2. Demonstrate strong data modeling, DAX, and visualization skills.
3. Deliver decision-ready insights in a professional reporting format.

Dataset & Model.
1. Period: 2015–2024.
2. Grain: Subject × Gender × Year.
3. Fact table: KCSE performance results.

Key Measures.
1. Total Candidates
2. Weighted Mean Score
3. Mean Grade / Grade Band
4. Overall Pass Rate (C+ and above)
5. Year-over-Year Mean Score Change
6. Subject Rank
7. Gender Mean Score Gap
8. Intervention Flag (On Track / Monitor / Urgent)

Dashboard Pages
1. Performance Overview – Executive summary of school-wide performance
2. Subject Performance Analysis – Subject ranking, trends, and volatility
3. Gender Performance Trends – Mean score gaps and pass-rate comparison
4. Subject Deep Dive – Detailed analysis of a selected subject vs school average
5. Interventions & Trends – Monitoring performance direction and stability

Tools & Technologies
1. Power BI Desktop (Windows)
2. DAX
3. MySQL (data preparation)

Assumptions & Limitations
Data is simulated and does not represent actual KCSE results
Real-world KCSE data would show greater year-to-year variability
Policy, curriculum, and cohort effects are not explicitly modeled
